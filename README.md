A new Flutter project.

## Setup

Before building or running the application, install the Flutter dependencies and produce a release build of the web bundle when needed:

1. Fetch dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. Create an optimized web build (optional for local validation):
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```
